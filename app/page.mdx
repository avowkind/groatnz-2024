I bring ideas from conception through implementation to production, working with teams using agile methodologies and modern tools. My approach balances innovation with reliability, focusing on solutions that deliver real value. 

With over 40 years of experience across software development, product management, systems design, and team leadership, I've worked in diverse industries: science, technology, engineering, health, automotive, transport, mobile, and travel. My recent work focuses on AI-first development with production LLM integration, building on a foundation of technical depth and practical management experience.

I've founded and run my own company and led startup software teams through high-growth periods. I've built multiple agile cross-functional teams, including a major open source project, established DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and modernized platforms with cloud deployments.


## Coder.
I've been writing code since my first Sinclair ZX80, building products both physical and virtual across diverse industries. Technology reinvents itself every few years and I've adapted many times and continue to embrace new tools and approaches.

I've built embedded systems, dataloggers, network devices, automotive systems, plant control systems, wearable health devices, mobile phones (actual phones, not just apps), web applications, databases, analysis tools, APIs, and distributed systems. Languages and tools have evolved from Forth and Assembler through C/C++, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, to current work with AI/ML tools including OpenAI API, Braintrust, and production LLM integration.

I combine deep technical curiosity with broad experience. I listen carefully to understand what customers need, design thoughtful UI/UX, and work with teams to build products that matter.

## Leader and Team builder.
I've created and led multiple Agile/Scrum teams, introduced CI/CD practices, evaluated and selected technologies, mentored developers, and stayed hands-on with code. My approach focuses on building teams that grow more effective over time—sustainable pace, minimal technical debt, continuous learning.

## Designer and Product developer.
Good software delivers measurable value to users—it meets their needs, is intuitive to use, and feels right. Under the hood, it needs to be sustainable: well-structured, maintainable, secure, and operable throughout its lifecycle.

I listen carefully to understand both what people ask for and what they actually need. This understanding guides technical decisions and design choices, with attention to what happens after delivery. 

## Learner & Teacher
I'm a lifelong learner. When I'm no longer growing or contributing effectively, it's time for new challenges. After building strong teams at NIWA and providing leadership and consulting on data science at Plant and Food Research, I returned to hands-on software development work, which I continue to find deeply rewarding.

I learn something new every day, both within and outside of IT—currently learning piano, and previously completed a virology course.
