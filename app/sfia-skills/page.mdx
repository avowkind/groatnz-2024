# IT Management Skills
The Skills Framework for the Information Age can be found at http://www.sfia-online.org. It provides a range of key terms across categories of IT including strategy, change, development etc. Many of the terms are compatible with ITIL - another widely used IT framework. For each term, there is a range of autonomy levels that represent growth in experience and capability for the role.

I developed a tool at NIWA to allow rapid creation of a SFIA skills position description. This link represents my current
